I write various [thought fragments](https://willschenk.com/fragments/), [lab notes](https://willschenk.com/labnotes/), [how to guides](https://willschenk.com/howto/) and the occasional [article](https://willschenk.com/articles/) over at [willschenk.com](https://willschenk.com)

Currently I am the [proprietor of Cornwall Market](https://www.cornwallmarket.com/) located in the Northwest Corner of Connecticut, also know as the [center of the universe](https://www.cornwallmarket.com/why-cornwall).

I'm also the cofounder of [Tezlab](https://tezlabapp.com) which is a mobile app that helps you understand how to use your Tesla and Rivian a bit better.

## Past

I ran [HappyFunCorp](https://happyfuncorp.com) from Sept 2009 to Jan 2022. I stepped down from [day to day operations](https://willschenk.com/fragments/2023/a_good_death/) in Janurary and we sold the company in November.

## Future

I'm starting a new project in the fall around effectively leveraging AI and AI-enabled tools.
